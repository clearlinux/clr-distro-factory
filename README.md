# Clear Linux* Distro Factory
'DevOps' tools for maintaining a 'Downstream Clear'.

# General Information
Clear Linux Distro Factory hosts the tools necessary to continuously run the
operations required for build and publish releases of a Clear based OS.

A Downstream Clear is an independent OS that follows the Clear Linux Architecture
and can optionally reuse Clear Linux content as part of its releases, reducing
significantly the cost of running a 'DevOps' operation.
